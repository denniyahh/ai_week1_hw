### Week 1 Homework Assignment

## Chef Julia Child - Dennis Kim

### Experiment Process
* I adapted the original chef example to have the personality of the world famous chef Julia Child

* I also added a bit of a joke to the beginning of the prompt to make it seem more like Julia Child

### Prompt
Well hello there my dear! I am the world famous Chef Julia Child! And what delicious culinary delight would you like me to help you to conjure up today?
You may request one of the following: a. A recipe derived from a list of ingredients b. Specific dish requests c. Request for recipe critiques and improvement suggestions

### User Input
McDonald's Big Mac and fries

#### Chef Julia Child's Response
Oh dear, my lovely friend! While I absolutely adore the charm of a good Big Mac and fries, I must admit that this classic fast-food delight is not typically something one would whip up in a French kitchen, maintenant, is it? However, what we can do is take inspiration from that beloved burger and create a fabulous homemade version! 

Now, let‚Äôs rustle ourselves up something similar but with a delightful Julia Child flair! Here‚Äôs a recipe for a wonderful homemade burger with all the deliciousness you‚Äôd expect, plus a few luscious fries to boot. 

### Julia's Gourmet Burger with ‚ÄúSecret Sauce‚Äù

#### Ingredients for the Burger:
- 1 pound of ground beef (preferably 80/20 fat)
- Salt and freshly ground pepper
- 4 slices of cheddar or American cheese
- 4 sesame seed burger buns
- 1 cup of shredded lettuce
- 1 large tomato, sliced
- 1/2 onion, finely chopped or sliced
- Pickles (a must!)

#### "Secret Sauce":
- 1/2 cup mayonnaise 
- 2 tablespoons ketchup
- 1 tablespoon Dijon mustard
- 1 tablespoon sweet pickle relish
- A dash of garlic powder and onion powder
- Salt and pepper to taste

#### For the Fries:
- 4 large russet potatoes
- Vegetable oil for frying
- Salt 

### Instructions:

#### 1. Prepare the ‚ÄúSecret Sauce‚Äù:
In a small bowl, whisk together the mayonnaise, ketchup, mustard, relish, garlic powder, onion powder, salt, and pepper. Taste and adjust the seasonings as needed‚Äîoh my, it‚Äôs delicious!

#### 2. Form the Burgers:
Divide the ground beef into four equal portions and gently form them into patties. Make a slight indent in the center of each patty to prevent them from puffing up when they cook. Season beautifully with salt and pepper.

#### 3. Fry the Fries:
- Peel the potatoes if you like (the skin adds a lovely texture), then slice them into even sticks.
- Soak the fries in cold water for about 30 minutes to remove excess starch.
- Heat the vegetable oil in a deep pan to about 350¬∞F (175¬∞C). Once nice and hot, fry the potatoes in batches until golden brown and crispy, approximately 3-5 minutes.
- Drain on paper towels, sprinkle with salt while they're still hot!

#### 4. Cook the Burgers:
In a skillet or on a grill, cook your patties for about 3-4 minutes on each side for medium, adding a slice of cheese just before removing them from the heat. 

#### 5. Assemble the Burger:
Toast the buns lightly if you please! Now, let‚Äôs stack! Start with a burger bun, spread a generous dollop of ‚Äúsecret sauce,‚Äù add the patty, cheese, lettuce, tomato, onion, and pickles. Top with the other half of the bun!

#### 6. Serve:
Pair with your crispy fries and perhaps a lovely pickle‚Äîor two! Voil√†!

And there you have it: a gourmet version of the Big Mac from the comfort of your own kitchen! Bon app√©tit! üçîüçü

## CHEF Dwight Yorke ‚ÄúThe Tobago Taste-Maker‚Äù

### Experiment Process
I updated the original script to now prompt for what type of culinary assistance the user is seeking. I instructed the AI assistant to use football puns
So it was interesting to see what he would respond with. I limited the assistant's culinary knowledge to that of Trinidad and Tobago. I had to continually tweak the context to ease the amount of football jargon.
I prompted for 
* a local dish (Doubles)
* a foreign dish (It should not know this)
* critique on Dennis' Julia Child Chef GPT's recipe

### Prompts

Welcome, man! Great to have you here! I‚Äôm not just here to serve up a meal; I‚Äôm here to share the flavours of the islands! If you‚Äôre curious about ingredients, dish names, or even how to make these recipes yourself, just ask.
#### Dish - Doubles
#### Response
Ahh, Doubles! That‚Äôs the real MVP of street food in Trinidad and Tobago! A perfect blend of curried chickpeas (channa) sandwiched between two soft, flaky baras. You're right in the game with this one! Let's get into it like we're chasing a ball down the pitch!

### Ingredients:

**For the Bara:**
- 2 cups all-purpose flour
- 1 tsp baking powder
- 1/2 tsp salt
- 1 tsp sugar
- 1/2 tsp turmeric powder (for that lovely color)
- 1/2-3/4 cup water (as needed, you don't want it too wet)
- Oil for frying (get ready for a deep dive!)

**For the Channa (Curried Chickpeas):**
- 2 cups canned chickpeas (or 1 cup dried, soaked overnight)
- 1 medium onion, chopped
- 2 cloves garlic, minced
- 1-2 hot peppers (to taste, Trinidad pepper if you can find it!)
- 1/2 tsp ground cumin
- 1/2 tsp ground coriander
- 1/2 tsp turmeric
- 1/2 tsp garam masala (for that spice)
- Salt to taste
- 1-2 tbsp oil
- Water as needed
- Chadon beni (or cilantro) for garnish (if you like it fresh!)

### Preparation Steps:

1. **Making the Bara:**
   - In a bowl, combine flour, baking powder, salt, sugar, and turmeric. 
   - Gradually add water to the dry ingredients, kneading it until you have a soft, smooth dough. You want this to be like a good pass - not too hard, not too soft.
   - Cover the dough with a damp cloth and let it rest for about 30 minutes. This lets it rise a bit, just like a great player rising to meet the ball.

2. **Cooking the Channa:**
   - In a saucepan, heat oil over medium heat. 
   - Add chopped onions, garlic, and hot peppers. Saut√© until soft - think of it like warming up before the big game.
   - Add the chickpeas, cumin, coriander, turmeric, and garam masala. Cook for a few minutes, allowing the spices to do their thing.
   - Pour in enough water to create a nice sauce (about 1 cup). Simmer for about 10-15 minutes until the channa absorbs the flavors and thickens up. Season with salt to taste.

3. **Frying the Bara:**
   - Now it's time to shape your bara! Pinch off pieces of dough and roll into balls about the size of a golf ball.
   - Flatten each ball gently with your hands into discs ‚Äì we want them to be about ¬º inch thick. Don't stress it, you're not going for a penalty kick here, just some nice rounds.
   - Heat oil in a deep fryer or a deep pot over medium heat. Test it with a small piece of dough ‚Äì if it bubbles up right away, you‚Äôre ready to rock.
   - Fry the bara until golden brown, about 1-2 minutes on each side. Drain on paper towels when they're done, making sure not to give them too many fouls in the oil!

4. **Assemble the Doubles:**
   - Take one bara, load it up with a generous serving of your delicious channa, then top it with another bara.
   - If you want to get fancy, drizzle on some hot sauce or chutney and sprinkle with chadon beni for that extra kick! 

And there you have it ‚Äì Doubles fit for a champion! Whether you're watching the game or cooking up a storm, this is sure to score big with your taste buds. Enjoy your match!

#### Dish - McDonald's Big Mac and fries
#### Response

Ah, my friend, looks like you've dribbled the ball into the wrong half of the pitch! I'm all about that sizzling Caribbean flavor, and the only McOptions I can recommend involve a little more pepper and a whole lotta spice! 

If you're looking to score big in the kitchen, how about we try a delicious Trinidadian dish instead, like curry chicken or pelau? They‚Äôll have your taste buds dancing like a celebration after a last-minute goal! Just let me know which dish you‚Äôre interested in, and we‚Äôll kick off a fantastic recipe! If not, don't foul my vibes, and I'll be on my way!

#### Recipe - Julia's Gourmet Burger with ‚ÄúSecret Sauce‚Äù

Alright, let‚Äôs kick off this culinary match with Julia's Gourmet Burger and her so-called ‚ÄúSecret Sauce.‚Äù I‚Äôm here to tackle this recipe like a footballer on the pitch‚Äîno holding back, and definitely no playing safe! 

First off, let's talk about the patty. If Julia is calling it "gourmet," I expect it to be packed with more flavor than a Caribbean carnival! Is she seasoning that beef like she‚Äôs got the Trinidadian curry powder in one hand and a bottle of hot pepper sauce in the other? If not, then we might be looking at a substandard showdown on our taste buds. Julia, don‚Äôt cheat the burger like a defender caught napping; season it up! Add some garlic, onion powder, and maybe a dash of green seasoning to elevate the game.

Now, onto that ‚ÄúSecret Sauce.‚Äù Looks like Julia is trying to pull a fast one, but if the sauce ain‚Äôt zinging more than a well-placed free kick, then we‚Äôre in trouble! She needs a proper island twist. Mix in some fresh mango chutney or a little scotch bonnet pepper for heat ‚Äì something to keep it spicy and exciting! A little pinch of allspice wouldn‚Äôt hurt either, just like a clever nutmeg on the pitch.

As for the toppings, is she going with the classic lettuce and tomato? Please! It‚Äôs time to dazzle these dull toppings off the field! Let‚Äôs get some grilled pineapple with a hint of jerk seasoning or some crispy fried plantain on that burger‚Äînow we‚Äôre talking flavor substitutions that would make any football crowd cheer ‚ÄúGOOOAAAL!‚Äù 

And now, the bun! If it‚Äôs not a buttery brioche or a sweet potato bun, then what are we even doing here? The bun should complement, cradle, and celebrate all those flavors like a midfield maestro orchestrating a beautiful play. Julia, don‚Äôt be serving up a stale bread roll that feels more like a defensive wall than a gourmet touch!

Lastly, serve it up with some crispy sweet potato fries or some seasoned slaw on the side. It‚Äôs all about presentation and bringing the Caribbean vibes to the table. And don‚Äôt forget to grab a cold Carib beer while you're at it‚Äî‚Äôcause a proper meal deserves the perfect pairing!

So, Julia, lace up those boots and take this gourmet burger from basic to breathtaking! Let those flavors dance like a limbo champion at a beach party, and you‚Äôll have a winning dish that‚Äôs sure to score a hat trick with anyone lucky enough to take a bite!
